A native desktop app that gathers every coding-agent session on your machine into one place — browse, full-text search, and resume any conversation in seconds. Built with **Rust + GPUI** (gpui 0.2 + gpui-component 0.5). macOS first; experimental Linux support since v0.2.5, experimental Windows support since v0.2.7.

Your agent history is scattered across `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, and a dozen other private directories. Wake reads them all, read-only, and gives you one fast window into it. Everything stays local; Wake only contacts GitHub when you explicitly check for an update.

## Features

- **Unified browsing** — all sessions grouped by agent / project, with Grok Build subagents nested under their parent and live file watching for incremental updates
- **Full-text search** (⌘K / Ctrl+K) — SQLite FTS5 trigram index; handles CJK text and code substrings (like `useEffect(`) equally well; jumps straight to the matched message in the transcript
- **Transcript view** — per-message rendering with user/assistant bubbles, inline images (copy or save them), collapsible tool-call clusters, thinking summaries, tree-sitter code highlighting (30+ languages)
- **One-click resume** — reopens the session in your terminal (Terminal/iTerm on macOS; native terminal hosts on Linux and Windows) at the original project directory (`claude --resume`, `codex resume`, …)
- **Manage** — star/pin (stored in Wake's own DB, original files untouched), export to Markdown or save an inline image through the system Save dialog (Wake remembers the last folder), delete (system Trash + tombstone so deleted sessions stay deleted)
- **Insights** — a stats page for your whole library: GitHub-style activity heatmap with streaks, hour / weekday / month breakdowns, and Agents / Projects / Models leaderboards switchable between sessions, tokens, and prompts
- **Remote hosts** — mirror the sessions on your other machines over SSH (Settings → Remote hosts); they show up next to local ones with an `@host` badge, searchable like everything else, and resume through a copied `ssh -t` command

**Model** = whether Wake shows which LLM a session used (the model the session last used). **Via** = whether Wake shows where the session was started from (CLI, IDE extension, desktop app) — Codex records this in its local data; Hermes and OpenClaw record the channel a session came in through (Telegram, Discord, …). A "—" means the agent's local data simply doesn't record that field, not a missing feature.

Cursor IDE chats, Windsurf, and Trae encrypt their local data; Amp, Factory (Droid), and Warp keep sessions in the cloud — none of those are supported. Reasonix stores sessions locally but hasn't been mapped yet.

## Remote hosts

Wake can mirror the sessions on your other machines and show them next to the local ones. Add a host in Settings → Remote hosts (an alias from `~/.ssh/config`, or `user@host`); Wake then syncs on launch, on refresh, and whenever you click Sync now. Remote sessions carry an `@host` badge, are searchable like everything else, and resume through *Copy SSH command*, a ready-to-paste `ssh -t <host> 'cd <project> && codex resume <id>'`.

Before you add a host:

- SSH has to work without prompts: load your key into an agent (Wake runs without a terminal, so it can never answer a passphrase prompt) and connect once from a terminal so the host key is already trusted
- `rsync` is needed on both ends — macOS and most Linux distributions ship one; on Windows install it yourself

How it works, and what it doesn't do yet:

- Wake first asks the remote which of the known agent directories exist, then mirrors only those with `rsync` into `remotes/<host>/` under its own data directory. Only session data and sidecar files are copied, never credentials, and nothing on the remote is ever written
- Remote sessions are read-only in Wake: they can't be moved to the Trash, and the mirror simply follows whatever is on the remote
- The remote is assumed to use each agent's default paths under the login user's home (`CODEX_HOME`-style overrides on the remote aren't detected), and remote Windows machines aren't supported

## Privacy stance

- Agent data directories are opened **read-only**; Wake never writes to another tool's files or databases
- Credential files (`auth.json` and friends) are never read
- Remote hosts are mirrored read-only with `rsync` over your existing SSH setup: only session data and its sidecar files come across (never credentials), nothing on the remote machine is ever written, and the mirror lives inside Wake's own data directory (`remotes/<host>/`), so removing the host removes it
- No background network requests — the only network actions are a user-initiated update check against Wake's public GitHub Release metadata and, if you configure remote hosts, SSH/rsync to those hosts on launch, refresh, and Sync now; session data is never sent anywhere else
- Wake's own index lives at `~/Library/Application Support/wake/wake.db` (Linux: `~/.local/share/wake`, Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wake`) and can be rebuilt from scratch at any time (stars/pins live in a separate table and survive rebuilds). Two small preference files (`appearance`, `window.json`) sit beside it on macOS, under `~/.config/wake` on Linux and `%APPDATA%\wake` on Windows; Open In and export-folder choices live in the index database's `prefs` table

## Performance

On the author's machine (~310 sessions, ~800 MB of JSONL): full index ~5 s, subsequent launches are instant (mtime-based incremental scan), search results in under 1 ms.

## Install

Download `Wake-<version>-macos.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/iAmCorey/Wake/releases/latest), unzip, and drag Wake to Applications. The release is a Universal Binary for both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. Or build from source (requires a Rust toolchain):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iAmCorey/Wake && cd Wake
scripts/make-app.sh          # builds dist/Wake.app (icon + Info.plist, ad-hoc signed)
open dist/Wake.app
```

To build the same Universal Binary locally, install the `aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-apple-darwin` Rust targets, then run `scripts/make-app.sh --universal`.

The app is ad-hoc signed, so if you download a prebuilt copy instead of building it yourself, macOS Gatekeeper will block the first launch — right-click the app and choose *Open*, or run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine Wake.app`.

### Linux (experimental)

Prebuilt packages for arm64 and x86_64 (asset names use Debian's `amd64`) are attached to each release: a `.deb`, and a tar.gz with a user-level `install.sh` (no root needed). Or build from source:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libasound2-dev libfontconfig1-dev libwayland-dev \
  libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libssl-dev libzstd-dev pkg-config cmake clang
git clone https://github.com/iAmCorey/Wake && cd Wake
scripts/make-linux.sh        # builds dist/wake-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz and .deb
```

The data layer, rendering and search are fully tested on Linux; terminal-resume targets and desktop integration have seen less real-desktop mileage yet — issues welcome.

### Windows (experimental)

Download `wake-<version>-windows-x86_64.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/iAmCorey/Wake/releases/latest), unzip, and run `Wake.exe` — the binary is unsigned, so SmartScreen may block the first launch (click *More info* → *Run anyway*). Or build from source (requires a Rust toolchain with the MSVC target):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/iAmCorey/Wake; cd Wake
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/make-windows.ps1   # builds dist/wake-<version>-windows-<arch>.zip
# or just: cargo run -p wake
```

Resume opens sessions in Windows Terminal, PowerShell (7+ or the built-in Windows PowerShell), Command Prompt, Alacritty or WezTerm (whichever are installed); delete goes to the Recycle Bin. Agent data lives in the same `~/.claude`-style directories under your user profile, so everything indexed on macOS/Linux is indexed here too. Same beta caveat as Linux: the data layer is fully tested, desktop integration has seen less mileage — issues welcome.

## Development

```bash
cargo run -p wake                      # run in dev mode
scripts/test.sh                        # one-command test entry: data-layer tests + UI compile gate
scripts/test.sh --smoke                # adds a real-data scan baseline (reads your local agent dirs, read-only)
cargo test -p wake-core                # data-layer tests only (adapter contracts, FTS, scanner)
cargo run -p wake-core --bin scan      # data-layer smoke test: scan and print stats
cargo run -p wake-core --bin scan -- --search "useEffect("   # search smoke test
WAKE_THEME=dark cargo run -p wake      # force dark/light (defaults to system)
WAKE_HOME=/path cargo run -p wake      # point all agent adapters at a different home dir (portable installs, testing)
WAKE_LIVE_REMOTE_HOST=<host> cargo test -p wake-core --test remote_sync live -- --ignored   # run the remote-host pipeline against a real SSH host
git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks   # optional: run tests before every commit
python3 scripts/demo-home.py           # build a synthetic fake-home dataset for screenshots/demos
```

CI runs `cargo test -p wake-core` plus a full app build on every push to main and every PR. The test suite parses synthetic fixture sessions only — your real agent data is never touched (the remote-host end-to-end test uses a fake `ssh` and your system `rsync` against a synthetic home).
